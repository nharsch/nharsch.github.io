## Background
I'm a data/backend focused full stack web developer, most comfortable with Clojure, Python, and Javascript.

I began my career in the arts and media, working at fine arts galleries, an independent record label, live theatre, then a media distribution company. I started learning to code to [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), which quickly led to a career as a Fullstack web Developer, then Data Engineer, now Technical Project Manager.
