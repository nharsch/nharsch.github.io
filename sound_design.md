I do Sound Design and original compositions for Theatre.

## Samples

I like to sample source material into warped tracks, like these:

I also make original musical pieces and soundscapes, like this:
<iframe width="100%" height="150" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244793385&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

But, if I had my way, I'd spend most days making stuff that sounds like this:
<iframe width="100%" height="350" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/320385434&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false"></iframe>


## Reel

Here are some pieces I made set to images of shows they're from:
