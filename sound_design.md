I do Sound Design and original compositions for Theatre and Film.

## Film
I provided an original score, sound design and final sound mix for this short film:

## Samples
I like to mangle sampled source material into warped tracks, like these:

## Instrumental
I also make original musical pieces and soundscapes, like this:
